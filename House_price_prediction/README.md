Machine Learning Projects 🚀

This repository contains a growing collection of Machine Learning projects focused on building strong fundamentals and practical understanding of core ML concepts. The projects in this repository are part of my structured learning journey in Machine Learning, with an emphasis on clarity, mathematical intuition, and real-world problem solving.

Currently, the repository includes two end-to-end Machine Learning projects, covering exploratory data analysis and supervised learning. More projects will be added gradually as I progress further into advanced Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Neural Networks.

Each project follows a systematic workflow including data understanding, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and result interpretation.

📌 Current Projects
